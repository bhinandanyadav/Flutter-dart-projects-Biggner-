## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **API Integration**
- The app uses OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data
- HTTP requests are made to: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`
- Weather data includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and visibility

### 2. **UI Components**
- **AppBar**: Contains the app title and search button
- **Search Dialog**: Modal dialog for city search with Hindi text
- **Weather Display**: Shows current weather with animations
- **Weather Details Card**: Glassmorphism card with weather metrics
- **Background Images**: Dynamic backgrounds based on weather conditions

### 3. **State Management**
- Uses Flutter's built-in `StatefulWidget` for state management
- Manages loading states, error handling, and weather data

### 4. **Responsive Design**
- `SingleChildScrollView` prevents overflow issues
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Proper padding and spacing for optimal viewing

## 🎨 UI Features

### Weather Icons
- Dynamic weather icons based on conditions:
  - ☀️ Clear weather
  - ☁️ Cloudy weather
  - 🌧️ Rainy weather
  - ⚡ Thunderstorm
  - ❄️ Snow
  - 🌫️ Fog/Mist

### Background Images
- Background changes based on weather conditions
- Glassmorphism effect with backdrop blur
- Gradient overlay for better text readability

### Animations
- Temperature counter animation
- Fade-in animations for weather data
- Smooth transitions between states

## 🔑 API Configuration

The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API with the following parameters:
- **Base URL**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`
- **Units**: Metric (Celsius)
- **Language**: English
- **Required Parameters**: 
  - `q`: City name
  - `appid`: Your API key
  - `units`: metric

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Error**
   - Ensure your OpenWeatherMap API key is valid
   - Check if you've exceeded the free tier limits

2. **Asset Loading Error**
   - Verify that all images are in `lib/assets/images/`
   - Check `pubspec.yaml` for correct asset paths

3. **Build Errors**
   - Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`
   - Ensure Flutter SDK is up to date

4. **Platform-specific Issues**
   - For Linux: Install required dependencies
   - For Android: Set up Android SDK
   - For iOS: Use macOS with Xcode
